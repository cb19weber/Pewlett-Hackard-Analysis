# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Module 7 of DU's Data Analytics bootcamp was all about getting accustomed to SQL and some tools to build databases and tables, and then query those datasets to create new tables based on requested information and export that information in .csv format. This project required the development of understanding entity relationship diagrams, and then applying that understanding to build queries that joined, filtered, created, and exported necessary data.

### Purpose
The specific purpose of this work is to work with an employee database to aid "Pewlett Hackard" in preparations for a potential mass exodus of current employees due to retirement, and then later to explore which currently employees might be good candidates for further training through a mentorship program as older employees transition away from the company.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of the Impact of Pending Retirements on Pewlett Hackard (Module)
The guided module helped to build an initial skillset applying SQL to harvest information and make the underlying data more useful. A variety of tables were built in the process, probably at a high level the most useful was the retirees by department to really give insight into the potential impact of an aging employee base. Pewlett Hackard is a relatively large company, with an underlying employee dataset of over 300,000 records. Being able to dig into that data and theorize the impact of employee transition is a powerful tool for the company to strategically prepare for the company's future.

After getting into the data, the retirees by department was an exceedingly useful table based on the initial premise of employees potential to retire based on age. The data certainly revealed the departments most heavily impacted based on the projection: Production and Development. With the datasets available, and particularly in light of employment trends in post-pandemic society, there are undoubtedly more projections that could be analyzed. It would be great to examine salary quartiles for each departmental role, and attempt to stem the tide of resignations by bringing highly valued, but potentially underpaid, employees up to the higher quartiles for their role within the company. This would also be especially useful to compare with market data for salaries based on title and industry.
